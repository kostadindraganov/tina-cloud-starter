* SlotMatrix hires Björn Sjöberg as its new CCO

SlotMatrix has strengthened its C-suite with the appointment of Björn Sjöberg as Chief Commercial Officer. A former Evolution veteran, Sjöberg joins the team at SlotMatrix to help spearhead one of the largest iGaming content platforms in the world.

## Sjöberg joins SlotMatrix to take it to new competitive heights

He is stepping in at a time when the aggregator has amassed an impressive portfolio of more than 36,000 games provided by over 350 accredited and acclaimed suppliers. SlotMatrix has recently also acquired [Fantasma Games](https://casino.guru/news/gambling-industry/everymatrix-to-proceed-with-fantasma-games-purchase-6023), a popular game maker for the iGaming sector, further enhancing the portfolio offering by injecting its hard-hitting, player-favorite, and innovative slot portfolio.

Sjöberg's most notable role within the industry is as part of Evolution Gaming, where he worked in various roles and positions for over eight years. He started out as a Key Account Manager and gradually transitioned through the company’s structure, securing positions as Head of SME, Head of KAM, and Chief Commercial Officer for Europe at the Swedish iGaming major.

He left the company in March 2024 and spent a stint in the iGaming industry in a self-employed capacity before his appointment with the team. On his profile, though, Sjöberg notes that his role began in January 2025, and he has already been part of the SlotMatrix team for four months.

> Commenting on Sjöberg’s arrival, EveryMatrix Co-Founder and CEO Ebbe Groes had this to say: "Björn is a fantastic addition to the senior commercial team. He has years of experience and brings invaluable knowhow that will serve us well as we accelerate both our own games development and continually strengthen third-party content."  

Groes was happy to point out that SlotMatrix has retained its competitive advantage over rivals and that the addition of Sjöberg could help take this to new heights.

As to Sjöberg himself, he was similarly pleased to be joining the team and hailed the rapid pace of growth EveryMatrix and SlotMatrix have demonstrated. He also commented on the Fantasma Games’ acquisition:

"The Fantasma acquisition is the icing on the cake when it comes to strengthening iGaming’s richest content offering. Looking at the plans we have for this year and ahead, without doubt, we will continue to exceed our customers’ expectations with the best content available," Sjöberg wrapped up.
