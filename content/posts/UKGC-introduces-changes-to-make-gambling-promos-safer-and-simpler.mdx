## UKGC outlines consumer-protection changes in bonusing rules

While the UKGC has maintained a fairly liberal approach to bonuses and promotions , the changes now seek to align the regulatory framework with the country’s more ambitious approach to consumer protection.

In a statement on its website, the regulator said that it was looking to mitigate the impact of potentially harmful offers by addressing the terms and conditions of promotional offers, as well as take aim at the "[cross-vertical](https://www.gamblingcommission.gov.uk/news/article/gambling-promotions-to-be-safer-and-simpler)" type of promotions which may advertise both a sports betting and casino product in the promo, for example.

The UKGC has first targeted these so-called mixed product promotional offers that incentivize players to place a bet on the outcome of an athletic competition but, at the same time, also play slot games.

Perhaps even more crucial, however, is the new restriction on the so-called playthrough requirement – the number of times you need to roll over a deposit or a bonus before you can release any winnings and withdraw them if you want to.

Although for a long time, the standard has been anything between 20x and 35x, the UKGC has now mandated that the maximum rollover requirements applicable to a bonus must be set at 10x or lower.

This would allow players to navigate the bonuses offered by sector companies with ease and not be confused by the 35x wagering requirement that some operators may apply on their casino products, for example.

## Changes to come before 2025 is out

A wagering condition of 35x would mean that if you need to clear £100, you will have to accumulate betting activity up to £3,500 but not deposit additional money as you keep staking the money you have, accounting for wins and losses.

This has been a common complaint by customers who have not fully understood how the specific condition works. The UKGC will similarly look to change its core rules, specifically Social Responsibility Code 5.1.1 (Rewards and Bonuses), to ensure that license holders will understand the change and what their duties and obligations under the licensure are.

The changes will come into effect on December 19, 2025, giving license-holders a year to prepare.
