To fully grasp the concept of tokenized sports betting, it's crucial to understand the underlying technologies that power it. Let's break down the core components:

### What is Blockchain Technology?

At its core, a blockchain is a distributed, immutable ledger that records transactions in a secure and transparent manner. Instead of relying on a central authority to verify and validate transactions, blockchain uses a network of computers to maintain a shared, synchronized copy of the ledger. This decentralized structure makes it incredibly difficult to tamper with or alter the recorded data.

Key characteristics of blockchain technology include:

* **Decentralization:** No single entity controls the network, reducing the risk of censorship or manipulation.
* **Transparency:** All transactions are publicly recorded and auditable on the blockchain.
* **Immutability:** Once a transaction is recorded on the blockchain, it cannot be altered or deleted.
* **Security:** Cryptographic techniques are used to secure the blockchain and prevent unauthorized access.

Different types of blockchains exist, including:

* **Public blockchains:** Open and permissionless, allowing anyone to participate in the network (e.g., Bitcoin, Ethereum).
* **Private blockchains:** Permissioned and controlled by a single organization, offering greater control over access and data.
* **Consortium blockchains:** Permissioned and governed by a group of organizations, providing a balance between decentralization and control.

For tokenized sports betting, public or consortium blockchains are typically used to ensure transparency and immutability of the betting process.

### The Role of Cryptocurrencies

Cryptocurrencies are digital or virtual currencies that use cryptography for security. They operate independently of a central bank and are often decentralized, meaning they are not controlled by any single entity.
