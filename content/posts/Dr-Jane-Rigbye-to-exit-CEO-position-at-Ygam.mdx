The award-winning charity offering evidence-based education to help combat problem gaming and gambling, Ygam, announced upcoming changes to its senior-level team.

The charity confirmed that its CEO, Dr Jane Rigbye, will be stepping down from her leadership role.

## Rigbye will transition to trustee at Ygam's Board

The announcement comes after Dr Rigbye held the role of CEO for three and a half years.

Per the confirmation from [Ygam](https://casino.guru/news/gambling-industry/gamcare-and-ygam-to-reach-2-million-young-people-through-professionals-1595), the CEO is expected to step down from her role in June.

While Dr Rigbye won't be leading the charity, she will be appointed to its Board as a trustee.

This will enable her to continue to support the charity's noble work and provide advice.

Ygam revealed that Helen Martin, its Chief Operating Officer, has been appointed to the role of Interim CEO.

While the search for a permanent CEO is ongoing, the charity's Board vowed to disclose further details in due time.

The [outgoing CEO](https://casino.guru/news/gambling-industry/lee-willows-steps-down-as-ygam-ceo--43) commented on the topic, Casino Guru News learned from a press release. "Leading Ygam has been an incredible honor. I am immensely proud of what we have achieved as a team, and I know the charity will continue to go from strength to strength," Dr Rigbye revealed.

She acknowledged the charity's important work, praising the efforts and passion of Ygam's dedicated team of experts.

Finally, Rigbye said: "While I am stepping down as CEO, I remain fully committed to Ygamâ€™s mission and look forward to continuing to support its vital work as a trustee."

## The CEO played a pivotal role in the charity's growth

Mike Wojcik, Ygam's Chair, thanked the outgoing CEO for her dedication and the numerous achievements she helped the charity achieve.

"Jane has played a pivotal role in strengthening our engagement with government and key stakeholders, championing the vital role of the third sector during a period of significant reform," the executive added.

Wojcik said that Ygam wishes Rigbye all the best and pointed to the strong foundation she helped create.

Finally, Wojcik outlined: "We are confident our senior leadership team will continue driving our strategy forward and making a meaningful impact."

While Rigbye led Ygam, the charity significantly grew its reach and at the same time completed an ambitious strategy and rebranding.

The current CEO also helped oversee the introduction of Ygam's new website.
