# Video Poker Variants: Finding Your Perfect Game Beyond the Spin Button

I'll never forget the first time I sat down at a video poker machine in Vegas. It was 2008, I was fresh out of college, and I thought I knew everything about gambling because I'd watched "Rounders" about 50 times. The casino floor buzzed with energy—slot machines chiming, dealers calling out bets—but something about those video poker machines caught my eye.

"How hard could it be?" I remember thinking. "It's just like regular poker, but on a screen."

Oh, how wrong I was. After losing $40 in about 10 minutes on a Deuces Wild machine (making absolutely terrible decisions along the way), I realized there was a whole world of strategy and variations I knew nothing about.

Fast forward to today, and video poker has become my casino game of choice. Not just because I eventually learned proper strategy, but because I discovered there are dozens of fascinating variants out there—each with their own quirks, odds, and optimal approaches.

So let's dive into the wild world of video poker variants and figure out which one might be right for you. Trust me, there's way more to this game than just hitting the "deal" button and hoping for the best.

## The Appeal of Video Poker: Why I Switched from Slots

Before we get into specific variants, let's talk about why video poker deserves your attention in the first place. Unlike slot machines—which I used to play religiously—video poker actually gives you real decisions that affect the outcome. And unlike table games, there's no intimidating dealer or other players watching your every move.

Back in 2019, I was on a weekend trip to Atlantic City with some friends. We were all playing slots, mindlessly pushing buttons, when I noticed something. A guy sitting at a video poker machine nearby seemed to be really thinking about each hand, occasionally celebrating small victories. He looked like he was having... actual fun? Not just the zombie-like state most of us slot players were in.

I wandered over during his break and struck up a conversation. Turns out he was a math professor who explained that many video poker variants offer some of the best odds in the entire casino—some even approaching 100% return with perfect play. He showed me a few basic strategy tips, and I was hooked.

The key advantages of video poker include:

* **Actual decision-making** (unlike slots where you're just a button-pusher)
* **Transparent odds** (you can see all the cards that could possibly be dealt)
* **Better payback percentages** than most casino games
* **Lower house edge** than slots (sometimes less than 1% with optimal play)
* **Solo play experience** without the pressure of table games

But here's where it gets interesting—and confusing for newcomers. There are dozens of video poker variants, each with different paytables, wild cards, and special features. Let's break down the most popular ones so you can find your perfect match.

## Jacks or Better: The Classic Starting Point

If you're new to video poker, Jacks or Better is your gateway drug. It's the vanilla ice cream of video poker—simple, classic, and a great baseline for understanding everything else.

The premise is straightforward: you need at least a pair of Jacks to win anything. The paytable typically looks something like this:

| Hand            | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| --------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Royal Flush     | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Straight Flush  | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four of a Kind  | 25     | 50      | 75      | 100     | 125     |
| Full House      | 9      | 18      | 27      | 36      | 45      |
| Flush           | 6      | 12      | 18      | 24      | 30      |
| Straight        | 4      | 8       | 12      | 16      | 20      |
| Three of a Kind | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Two Pair        | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Jacks or Better | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

What I love about Jacks or Better is its simplicity. There are no wild cards or special features to complicate things. Just pure poker hand rankings with a minimum qualifying hand of a pair of Jacks.

A quick personal story: When I first started playing Jacks or Better seriously, I printed out a basic strategy chart and kept it in my wallet. The casino floor manager once saw me referencing it and came over. Instead of asking me to put it away (which I feared), he actually complimented me for taking the time to learn proper strategy! That's when I knew video poker was different from other casino games—even the house respects strategic players.

The optimal strategy for Jacks or Better isn't terribly complicated, but it does require memorizing a hierarchy of hands to hold. For example, you'd always hold a paying pair over four cards to a flush. These small decisions make a huge difference in your expected return.

For beginners, I recommend finding a "9/6 Jacks or Better" machine—that means it pays 9 coins for a full house and 6 for a flush (per coin wagered). With perfect play, these machines return about 99.54%, which is excellent for any casino game.

## Deuces Wild: Where 2s Change Everything

After I got comfortable with Jacks or Better, I decided to try something with a bit more excitement. Enter Deuces Wild—a game that fundamentally changes the dynamics of video poker by making all four 2s wild cards.

My first experience with Deuces Wild was... humbling. I sat down thinking my Jacks or Better strategy would transfer over. It did not. I made rookie mistakes like holding a single deuce with a pair of Kings (never do this), and my bankroll suffered accordingly.

What makes Deuces Wild so different is that the wild cards dramatically change both the paytable and optimal strategy. Here's what a typical Deuces Wild paytable looks like:

| Hand                | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Natural Royal Flush | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Four Deuces         | 200    | 400     | 600     | 800     | 1000    |
| Wild Royal Flush    | 25     | 50      | 75      | 100     | 125     |
| Five of a Kind      | 15     | 30      | 45      | 60      | 75      |
| Straight Flush      | 9      | 18      | 27      | 36      | 45      |
| Four of a Kind      | 5      | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Full House          | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Flush               | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Straight            | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Three of a Kind     | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

Notice something? There's no payment for pairs or even two pairs! The minimum paying hand is three of a kind. This makes sense when you consider how much easier it is to make strong hands with four wild cards in the deck.

The strategy for Deuces Wild is quite different from Jacks or Better. For example, you'll almost always hold a single deuce by itself, even if you have other "good" cards. The potential of that wild card is just too valuable to pass up.

A "full-pay" Deuces Wild machine (sometimes called "Nevada Deuces") can actually offer slightly over 100% return with perfect play—meaning the player has a theoretical edge over the house. These are increasingly rare, but you can still find them if you know where to look. I found one in downtown Las Vegas last year, and it became my home for most of that trip.

## Bonus Poker: When Four of a Kind Pays Big

After mastering the basics of Jacks or Better and dabbling in Deuces Wild, I discovered Bonus Poker—which quickly became one of my favorites for its exciting four-of-a-kind payouts.

Bonus Poker is essentially Jacks or Better with enhanced payouts for four-of-a-kind hands, particularly for Aces. The trade-off? Slightly reduced payouts for full houses and flushes.

A typical Bonus Poker paytable might look like this:

| Hand               | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Royal Flush        | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Straight Flush     | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four Aces          | 80     | 160     | 240     | 320     | 400     |
| Four 2s, 3s, or 4s | 40     | 80      | 120     | 160     | 200     |
| Four 5s through Ks | 25     | 50      | 75      | 100     | 125     |
| Full House         | 8      | 16      | 24      | 32      | 40      |
| Flush              | 5      | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Straight           | 4      | 8       | 12      | 16      | 20      |
| Three of a Kind    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Two Pair           | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Jacks or Better    | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

The strategy for Bonus Poker is similar to Jacks or Better but with some key differences that account for the increased value of certain four-of-a-kind hands.

I remember playing Bonus Poker during a trip to Reno in 2022 when I hit four Aces on a $1 machine. The 80 coin payout (playing max coins) gave me $80 on a $5 bet—not life-changing, but definitely a rush! The possibility of these bigger hits keeps the game exciting while still maintaining relatively low volatility.

The optimal 8/5 Bonus Poker machines offer about 99.17% return with perfect play—slightly worse than 9/6 Jacks or Better, but the excitement of those four-of-a-kind bonuses makes up for it, in my opinion.

## Double Bonus Poker: High Risk, High Reward

If Bonus Poker offers a taste of excitement with its enhanced four-of-a-kind payouts, Double Bonus Poker cranks it up several notches. This variant takes the four-of-a-kind bonuses even further but makes another significant change: reducing the payout for two pair to just 1x your bet (instead of the usual 2x).

I discovered Double Bonus Poker during a particularly lucky session at the Bellagio in 2020. I was up about $200 playing regular Bonus Poker when I decided to try something new. The machine next to me was a 10/7 Double Bonus game (10x for full house, 7x for flush), which offers one of the best returns in video poker.

Here's what a good Double Bonus paytable looks like:

| Hand               | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Royal Flush        | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Straight Flush     | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four Aces          | 160    | 320     | 480     | 640     | 800     |
| Four 2s, 3s, or 4s | 80     | 160     | 240     | 320     | 400     |
| Four 5s through Ks | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Full House         | 10     | 20      | 30      | 40      | 50      |
| Flush              | 7      | 14      | 21      | 28      | 35      |
| Straight           | 5      | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Three of a Kind    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Two Pair           | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
| Jacks or Better    | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

The reduced payout for two pair might seem minor, but it dramatically increases the volatility of the game. You'll have many more losing hands, but the potential for big wins with four-of-a-kind hands (especially Aces) keeps things interesting.

The optimal 10/7 Double Bonus machines return about 100.17% with perfect play—one of the few casino games where the player actually has a theoretical advantage. However, this comes with a catch: you need a much larger bankroll to weather the increased volatility.

I learned this the hard way during that Bellagio session. While I did eventually hit four Aces for a nice $800 payout (playing $5 per hand), I went through some serious swings getting there. My advice? Only play Double Bonus if you have the bankroll to handle 10-15 consecutive losing hands, which happens more frequently than you might expect.

## Triple Double Bonus: For the True Thrill-Seekers

If you thought Double Bonus was exciting, Triple Double Bonus takes things to a whole new level of volatility. This variant offers massive payouts for four Aces with a kicker (the fifth card) of 2, 3, or 4, as well as enhanced payouts for other four-of-a-kind hands with specific kickers.

I first encountered Triple Double Bonus during a 2024 trip to the newly renovated Fontainebleau Las Vegas. They had a bank of these machines near the high-limit room, and I was intrigued by the potential 800-coin payout for four Aces with a 2, 3, or 4 kicker.

Here's what a typical Triple Double Bonus paytable looks like:

| Hand                      | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Royal Flush               | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Straight Flush            | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four Aces with 2, 3, or 4 | 800    | 1600    | 2400    | 3200    | 4000    |
| Four 2s, 3s, 4s with A-4  | 400    | 800     | 1200    | 1600    | 2000    |
| Four Aces                 | 160    | 320     | 480     | 640     | 800     |
| Four 2s, 3s, or 4s        | 80     | 160     | 240     | 320     | 400     |
| Four 5s through Ks        | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Full House                | 9      | 18      | 27      | 36      | 45      |
| Flush                     | 6      | 12      | 18      | 24      | 30      |
| Straight                  | 4      | 8       | 12      | 16      | 20      |
| Three of a Kind           | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Two Pair                  | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
| Jacks or Better           | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

The optimal strategy for Triple Double Bonus is quite complex, as you need to consider not just the cards you're holding but also the potential kickers. For example, you might break up a paying pair of Jacks if you have an Ace with a 2, 3, or 4—something you'd never do in other variants.

A good 9/6 Triple Double Bonus machine returns about 98.15% with perfect play, but the volatility is extreme. You can easily go 50 or more hands without a significant win, then suddenly hit a four Aces with a kicker for an 800x payout.

During my Fontainebleau session, I experienced both the agony and ecstasy of Triple Double Bonus. I was down about $300 playing $5 per hand when I finally hit four 2s with an Ace kicker for a $2,000 win. The rush was incredible, but I'm not sure my heart (or my bankroll) could handle playing this variant regularly.

## Joker Poker: The Wild Card Alternative

If Deuces Wild seems too volatile but you still want the excitement of wild cards, Joker Poker offers a nice middle ground. This variant adds a single Joker to the standard 52-card deck, and that Joker acts as a wild card that can substitute for any card to make the best possible hand.

I discovered Joker Poker during a cruise to Alaska in 2021. The ship's casino had limited options, but their Joker Poker machine offered a surprisingly good paytable. Since we were at sea and I had time to kill, I decided to learn proper strategy.

A typical "Kings or Better" Joker Poker paytable looks like this:

| Hand                | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------- | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Natural Royal Flush | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Five of a Kind      | 200    | 400     | 600     | 800     | 1000    |
| Wild Royal Flush    | 100    | 200     | 300     | 400     | 500     |
| Straight Flush      | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four of a Kind      | 20     | 40      | 60      | 80      | 100     |
| Full House          | 7      | 14      | 21      | 28      | 35      |
| Flush               | 5      | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Straight            | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Three of a Kind     | 2      | 4       | 6       | 8       | 10      |
| Two Pair            | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
| Kings or Better     | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

Note that the minimum paying hand is a pair of Kings or better (hence "Kings or Better" Joker Poker). Some versions require Aces or better, which increases the volatility slightly.

The strategy for Joker Poker falls somewhere between Jacks or Better and Deuces Wild. The single wild card creates interesting decisions, especially when you have borderline hands.

The best full-pay Joker Poker machines return about 100.6% with perfect play, but these are extremely rare now. More commonly, you'll find versions that return between 97% and 99%.

What I love about Joker Poker is that it offers the excitement of wild cards without the extreme volatility of Deuces Wild. That cruise ship session turned out to be quite profitable—I won about $600 over three days of casual play, which more than paid for my shore excursions!

## Super Aces: The Sleeper Hit

One variant that doesn't get enough attention is Super Aces. This game is similar to Bonus Poker but with an even greater emphasis on four Aces. The first time I encountered it was at a small casino in Laughlin, Nevada, in 2023. I almost walked right past it, but the "400 COINS FOR 4 ACES" sign caught my eye.

A typical Super Aces paytable looks like this:

| Hand               | 1 Coin | 2 Coins | 3 Coins | 4 Coins | 5 Coins |
| ------------------ | ------ | ------- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| Royal Flush        | 250    | 500     | 750     | 1000    | 4000    |
| Straight Flush     | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Four Aces          | 400    | 800     | 1200    | 1600    | 2000    |
| Four 2s, 3s, or 4s | 80     | 160     | 240     | 320     | 400     |
| Four 5s through Ks | 50     | 100     | 150     | 200     | 250     |
| Full House         | 7      | 14      | 21      | 28      | 35      |
| Flush              | 5      | 10      | 15      | 20      | 25      |
| Straight           | 4      | 8       | 12      | 16      | 20      |
| Three of a Kind    | 3      | 6       | 9       | 12      | 15      |
| Two Pair           | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |
| Jacks or Better    | 1      | 2       | 3       | 4       | 5       |

The massive 400-coin payout for four Aces makes this game particularly exciting. With a $1.25 max bet ($0.25 denomination, 5 coins), hitting four Aces would pay $100—a nice return on a quarter machine.

The strategy for Super Aces is similar to Double Bonus Poker but with even more emphasis on holding Aces whenever possible. You'll sometimes make counterintuitive plays like breaking up two pair if one of the pairs is Aces.

Good Super Aces machines can return around 98.5% with perfect play. The volatility is high but not as extreme as Triple Double Bonus.

During my Laughlin session, I did eventually hit four Aces—it took about two hours of play, but the $100 payout on a quarter machine felt like a major score. The rush of seeing those four Aces line up is something I still remember vividly.

## How to Choose Your Video Poker Variant

With so many options, how do you decide which video poker variant is right for you? Here are some factors to consider based on my experience:

### 1. Your Bankroll Size

Different variants require different bankroll sizes due to their volatility:

* **Low Volatility** (smaller bankroll): Jacks or Better, 8/5 Bonus Poker
* **Medium Volatility** (moderate bankroll): Deuces Wild, Joker Poker
* **High Volatility** (larger bankroll): Double Bonus, Super Aces
* **Extreme Volatility** (significant bankroll): Triple Double Bonus

As a rule of thumb, I recommend having at least 100 max bets for low volatility games, 150 for medium volatility, and 200+ for high volatility variants. For example, if you're playing a $1 machine with a 5-coin max bet ($5 per hand), you should have at least $500 for Jacks or Better but $1,000+ for Triple Double Bonus.

### 2. Your Risk Tolerance

Be honest with yourself about how you handle losing streaks:

* If losing 10-15 hands in a row will make you anxious, stick with low-volatility games like Jacks or Better.
* If you enjoy the thrill of big wins but can handle the dry spells, high-volatility games like Double Bonus might be for you.
* If you're somewhere in between, Bonus Poker or Joker Poker offer a nice balance.

I learned my own risk tolerance the hard way. During one Vegas trip, I tried playing Triple Double Bonus exclusively and found myself getting frustrated during the inevitable long losing streaks. Now I mix it up—playing higher volatility games when I'm feeling lucky and have the bankroll, but sticking to Jacks or Better or Bonus Poker for longer sessions.

### 3. Your Strategy Commitment

Some variants require more complex strategy than others:

* **Simpler Strategy**: Jacks or Better, Bonus Poker
* **Moderate Strategy**: Deuces Wild, Joker Poker
* **Complex Strategy**: Double Bonus, Triple Double Bonus

Be realistic about how much strategy you're willing to learn and apply. Using a strategy card at the machine is perfectly acceptable (and smart), but some people prefer games where the decisions are more intuitive.

### 4. Paytable Hunting

Perhaps the most important factor in choosing a video poker variant is finding the best paytables. A good paytable on a "simpler" game like Jacks or Better can be better than a poor paytable on a more complex game.

Some key full-pay versions to look for:

* **9/6 Jacks or Better** (99.54% return)
* **Full-pay Deuces Wild** (100.76% return)
* **10/7 Double Bonus** (100.17% return)
* **9/6 Double Double Bonus** (98.98% return)
* **Kings or Better Joker Poker** (100.64% return)

I always check the paytable before sitting down at any video poker machine. The difference between a 9/6 Jacks or Better and an 8/5 version might not seem huge, but it represents nearly a 2% swing in expected return—the difference between a good game and a terrible one.

## My Personal Recommendations for Different Player Types

After years of playing various video poker games, here are my recommendations based on player type:

### For Absolute Beginners

**Start with 9/6 Jacks or Better.** The strategy is relatively straightforward, the volatility is low, and the 99.54% return with perfect play is excellent. Print out a strategy card and keep it with you until you've memorized the basic decisions.

I still remember teaching my dad to play Jacks or Better during a trip to Biloxi. He was intimidated at first but quickly got the hang of it. By the end of the weekend, he was making most decisions correctly without referencing the strategy card.

### For Low-Risk Players Who Want Excitement

**Try 8/5 Bonus Poker.** The enhanced four-of-a-kind payouts add excitement without dramatically increasing volatility. The 99.17% return is still excellent, and the strategy is very similar to Jacks or Better.

### For Players Ready for Wild Cards

**Graduate to Deuces Wild.** Once you're comfortable with basic video poker concepts, Deuces Wild offers an entirely different experience. The four wild cards create exciting possibilities, and full-pay versions offer returns over 100%. Just be prepared for a learning curve with the strategy.

### For High-Risk, High-Reward Players

**Double Bonus or Super Aces.** These games offer substantial payouts for four-of-a-kind hands without the extreme volatility of Triple Double Bonus. With good paytables, they offer returns of 99%+ with perfect play.

### For Maximum Thrill-Seekers

**Triple Double Bonus.** The massive payouts for four Aces with kickers create the potential for huge wins. Just be prepared for significant swings and make sure your bankroll can handle it.

## Final Thoughts: Finding Your Video Poker Sweet Spot

Video poker is unique in the casino world—it combines the approachability of slot machines with the strategy of poker and some of the best odds in the house. Finding your perfect variant is a personal journey that depends on your risk tolerance, bankroll, and what you find most enjoyable.

I've gone through phases with different variants over the years. These days, I typically start sessions with Bonus Poker or Double Bonus to build my bankroll, then maybe try some Triple Double Bonus if I'm ahead. If I'm having a rough day, I'll retreat to the comfort of Jacks or Better to minimize losses.

The beauty of video poker is that you can always find a game that matches your mood and bankroll situation. Unlike most casino games, you have genuine agency in the outcome—your decisions matter, and improving your play directly improves your returns.

So next time you're in a casino, look beyond the flashing slot machines and give video poker a try. Start with Jacks or Better, learn proper strategy, and gradually explore other variants as your comfort and confidence grow. You might just find, as I did, that it becomes your game of choice.

And if you see someone hunched over a Triple Double Bonus machine muttering "come on, Ace of spades with a 2 kicker"—that might be me. Feel free to say hello, but maybe wait until after the hand is over. We video poker players can be a superstitious bunch!
