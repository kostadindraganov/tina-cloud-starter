Mega Bonanza launched in mid-2024, making it one of the best sweepstakes casinos to explore. The social casino focuses on slots and live dealers, featuring 1,200+ games from top-notch companies like Playtech and Relax Gaming.

All players from supported states can claim real cash prizes by possessing at least 75 redeemable Sweeps Coins, but if you’d rather have gift cards, you can bag them for just 10 redeemable SCs. To start you off, Mega Bonanza gifts 2.5 SC and 7,500 GC instantly after registration. A 150% boost is extended on your first $9.99 purchase.

Some of the things I loved the most were huge referral bonuses, regular tournaments, a highly navigable user interface, and superb games from top-rated developers. Continue below for additional information and my honest views after thoroughly testing Mega Bonanza.
