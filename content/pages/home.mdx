      ## **Editors**


      **Click this box to start editing it**. You dwill see the matching field
      appear in the left sidebar for you to make changes. The edits will show in
      this live preview. In that left panel, you can also navigate around the
      page to change what you are editing (or just click a component here in the
      preview, like you did before).


      **Clicking 'Save' won't do anything in this demo** - but on your site it
      will save the changes immediately or send an approval request to your team
      for review.

      This project is set up to show you the basics of working with Tina. You're
      looking at the landing page, which pulls content from
      `content/pages/home.md`, components from components/blocks, and puts them
      all together in `pages/[filename].tsx`, all based on a config
      `tina/config.tsx`.
