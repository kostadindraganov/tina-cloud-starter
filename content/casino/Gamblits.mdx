Gamblits, established in 2025 and licensed in Anjouan (Comoros), is a modern hybrid casino platform offering a dynamic blend of live-dealer tables and virtual games from leading providers like Evolution, NetEnt, Pragmatic Play, and Nolimit City.

The platform supports both fiat (VISA, Mastercard, ApplePay, Google Pay) and cryptocurrencies (BTC, ETH, LTC, SOL, TRX, USDT, USDC), with deposits starting at just €20—and withdrawals processed through e‑wallets within 24 hours (€200 minimum).

New players can take advantage of a tiered welcome package—ranging from 100% to 300% boosts across the first three deposits, along with up to 100 free spins (usually on popular titles like Big Bass Bonanza)—subject to 25–40 × wagering and capped cashouts (€400–€1,000).

A five-level loyalty system (Spark → Storm) delivers daily cashback of 3–20% with no wagering requirements.

Gamblits implements standard security measures such as SSL encryption, KYC verification, and 24/7 live‑chat support in multiple languages (English, German, French, Norwegian). Withdrawal limits are €2,000/day, €10,000/week, and €20,000/month.
