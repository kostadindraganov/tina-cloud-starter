Consistency wins big at Roman Casino - one of the most engaging brands that came out in 2024. Every player is automatically enrolled in the loyalty program, which includes 4 ranks (Bronze, Silver, Gold and Platinum), each divided into several sub-ranks.Reaching a rank allows you to participate in exclusive tournaments!

Ranks also determine the percentage of your rakeback bonuses and cashbacks as their value is gradually increasing. At the "Silver" rank, the cashback is 1%, while the rakeback is 2%.

Roman Casino has also equipped itself with a loyalty coin system that can be found on the "Wheel" page. Unlike the loyalty rank, this one requires more active participation.

Also, you must complete "missions" in order to earn coins. These are very basic challenges for the most part. Make a deposit, register for a tournament, verify your phone number, etc. With the accumulated coins, you can then enjoy rewards! Roman Casino will keep players hooked up and will pleasantly surprise even the most experienced ones!
