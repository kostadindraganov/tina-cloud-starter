# Active Context

## Current Focus
The current focus is on initializing the project's memory bank structure to enable better documentation and context retention between sessions.

## Recent Changes
- Initialized the Cursor Memory Bank structure
- Created all core memory bank files:
  - projectbrief.md
  - productContext.md
  - systemPatterns.md
  - techContext.md
  - activeContext.md (this file)
  - progress.md

## Next Steps
- Explore the existing project structure in more detail
- Document any specific features or components that may need dedicated documentation
- Set up proper .cursorrules to capture project patterns
- Begin implementing/improving features based on project requirements

## Active Decisions & Considerations
- Using the Memory Bank structure to maintain project context between sessions
- Following the existing technical stack:
  - Next.js (App Router)
  - TinaCMS
  - TypeScript
  - Tailwind CSS
  - Shadcn UI / Radix UI
  - PNPM
- Ensuring all documentation aligns with the project's actual implementation
- Considering how to best document TinaCMS-specific patterns and workflows
